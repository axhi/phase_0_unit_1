Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I sepnt a lot of the time I should have been resarching, browsing the sites and reading articles on them. I suppose that just soldifies why they are my favorite sites, however. I found that viewing the sites with the list of analytical questions that were asked made me look and notice different things about the sites that I liked. 
The excercise was eye opening and building a blog template was pretty fun.
