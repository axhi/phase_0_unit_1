Hello team,

My name is Joey Sabani and I currently live in Madison, WI. I'm from the Chicago area originally and am extremely excited to get back there for DBC!

If you visit this link, you will see a list and some information about my three favorite websites. The Chive, ESPN and Smashing Magazine. 

According to that survey we took, my thinking style is Abstract Random. That thinking style means I learn through reflection and LOVE unstructured, people-oriented environments. This could not be more true of me and I'm excited to be thrusted into DBC and see how my thinking style holds up. 

VARK said my learning style is multi-modal. I like to learn in all types of environments using many different methods of informational intake. 

Sorry this is long, I feel like a simple 'Hey, nice to meet you' would have got this ball rolling, but now you know a bit about me too.

Also, I will be out of the country between May 23 - June 2 so my availability for peer pairing sessions will likely be limited. I will be doing my week out there and also participating in a GPS while I'm out there. Otherwise, I'm available after 5(CST) any day to get together and hammer out some PP sessions.

I look forward to hearing from all of you the next 3 weeks and meeting you all in July!

Joey

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

When I was reading a lot of the cultural blogs, people were expressing the same sentiment about DBC as I felt before and after the fireside chat. I saw a few people write the phrase 'you get out what you put in' as how the see the program running and what exactly they should expect from the program as a whole. 

At times I feel frusturated as to how much is being asked of us in the prep, but then I take a breath and understand the need for this. I need to commit myself to this entirely, and I am truly excited to do so.
