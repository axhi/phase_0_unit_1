## 5. [HTML/CSS Solo Challenge](5_HTML_CSS_solo_challenge/readme.md) Reflection

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

* I, first off, asked myself 'what is it that I am trying to do here?' By that, I was trying to solve the issue of "what is the problem?" I had a really formal set of guidelines of what I needed to do to accomplish the task at hand. I didn't really look at any outside resources outside of the ones that were listed on this module.
* The div positioning is still a little hazy for me, just understanding where an aboslute lives inside a relative div. I am going to read some more about it and see what I can learn for future use. I did learn that the way you put div's in your code (the order) directly relates to how it displays. 
* Other than what I wrote above, not really.
* The ultimate positioning is still something I want to work on, but displaying HTML with tags is something I grasp pretty well.
* I liked that you were told to do this last. I feel like it could have been interesting if I were to try this before making my blog posts. 
* It did feel like some of the experiment parts in relase 1, contradict release 2. Not sure what 'final' aspect should be due to this.
