## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* You can go to github.com/new to create a new repository. If you aren't logged in, it will ask you to. This screen has a few options for repoositry creation. First, you need to name you repositroy. Another key thing is to make it public or private. Finally, you will want to assign some licensing to your repositry. After you create your repo, you can open the GitHub application on your computer and search for your new repo. Selecting the repo in your program will give you the option of cloning it to a local directory on your computer.
* Open source means that whatever you have created is freely available through a like license to anyone. In relation to program, this means that a program or code you write, if open-sourced, is available for edit and modification by anyone. There is a large emphasis on open source meaning open collaboration.
* I feel that open source creates an enviornment to help the advancement of technology for everyone. I don't really feel nervous or protective, but then again, I haven't really created anything in this realm to feel such emotions towards open source.
* Licenses are extremely important to encourage the growth of your code while maintaining your rights within the code (except in the case of public-domain). If you develop something that could garner a lot of attention, having a license afford you the ability to let people work and distribute the software without having to review every request.
* I really didn't understand what open source was and had no idea that a general public license still had restrictions and didn't completely remove the creator from the project. I felt pretty confident with this challenge.
* I used Wikipedia to get a stronger handle on open source.
