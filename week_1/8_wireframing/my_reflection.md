## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

* * I suppose the main thing I learned from this was that before you jump into coding something, you should have a plan. I find myself doing just the opposite a lot of times and then realizing I forgot something. I probably save 3-4 hours in the beginning of the proccess and lose 6-10 hours fixing all the mistakes I made in the latter. 
* I didn't like doing it, but I found the value and will make an honest effort to use it in the future. I also think the first step in wireframing (finding the problem and a solution to it) should be done no matter what. Then, at the very least, sketching something out should be the next stepâ€“not coding.

* The main question I had, and didn't really come to a strong conclusion aside from the fact that I included them, was: do you need to wireframe spots for ads? It seems important and every website that isn't a commercial sales site (i.e. a site for Nissan), will probably have external ads.
