## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* The first thing I learned was that the 'web' is not the 'internet'. That was interesting. Also, I didn't know that the Olympics dance during the London Olmypics was for Tim Burners-Lee. Then I didn't really know how I missed that.
* A really important aspect is to remember to close tags, when you aren't using a helpful editor like Sublime that will close tags for you, at least. 
* What was really funny was when I read about 3 articles on DNS, and then freaked out when my site wsan't live instantly. But when I saw it come up, it was pretty cool.
* The concepts were solidifed. 
* I did look up the GitHub Pages website, but I'm not sure that it really helped me with anything.
