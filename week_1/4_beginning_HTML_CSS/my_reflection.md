## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* I've been exposed to HTML for quite some time, but the thing that makes most sense is that it renders text in its most simple form. If all else fails, you can just type out words and they should appear in your web page. 
* The great thing about HTML is its extreme flexability. It seems like you can incorporate many things into HTML to make it powerful and beautiful. The bad primarily revolves around browsers. There are so many options that need to be in compliance. This means both with current versions and past versions. 
* I felt that some of the optional resources were good at helping to solidify my understanding of HTML and CSS. 
* I use a lot of http://www.w3schools.com/ to help refresh me on topics or to learn about something in these realms.
