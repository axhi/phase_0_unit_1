## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

* A big thing was getting the keychain setup in my terminal. Sometimes, terminal does not provide feedback as to if you did something correctly. But, I guess if it doesn't say anything you didn't error out.
* What really worked for me in distinguishing between git and GitHub was the idea of locally and remotely available files. GitHub is accessible by way of the Internet and git is stored and edited locally on a computer. Git remains local unless you attach a GitHub address to it, which would then allow your files to be shared with anyone. 
* Version control is, in the simplest of terms, is like a giant "track changes" from Word. Version control lets you make changes, but see where you came from after you make those changes. This also allows you to go back and restore a version that was working or before some alternate changes. This is extremely important as multiple people may be collobrating on something and if one item was changed, it would be great to see how and why you got there.
* I don't know if I figured out this keychain thing, so I'll be interested to test that. I don't understand why you would ever want to work in just git, why not store your files online always? The need for version control makes perfect sense and, honestly, could have saved my ass in many previous scenarios.
