# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://axhi.github.io

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
	* I learned that when you are trying to provide the user with the best experience, it takes a lot of time to ensure this is happening initially but can save time, effort and headaches in the future. I also think there was an awesome stat in one of the articles I read that stated 70% of people will leave your website after 3 seconds spent on there. This just means it is incredibly important that the people that do stay, are having a great experience.
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
	* I loved working on the site, a lot. I spent WAY too much time on it, even after all the time reflections and the challenge telling me not to. I found myself tweakign and tweaking, it could be like this forever.
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
	* I followed the entire proccess as listed and then when I get to the actual coding, I referenced my wireframe way more than my plan. Also, my site didn't turn out exactly like I drew it. I kind of thought this would happen, mid way through my programming. 
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
	* I would like to add more content and images, as well as some boxes that can be hovered to provide a snippet of my work in the WORK section. 
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
	* There were many times where I had to lookup the syntax for a special selector or division. I also tried to implement some HTML5 page elements to no avail. 
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
	* I did use kuler.adobe.com for my website color selections and I found an HTML5 cheatsheet that I seemed to have closed out.
