# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
	* Responsive design is the ability to design one website for multiple viewport sizes and I think it is a GREAT practice. I see so many websites that are made just for one device and if you want the greatest reachâ€“designing this way will help achieve that. 
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
	* Smartphones and tablets have required web developers/designers to build sites that are easy to navigate and have content displayed in a way that can be consumed on a 400px screen. Before tablets, there was a 'standard' design size for websites and almost all sites looked like that. When screens went from 15" to 30" monitors, websites began to grow and become more beautiful with these advancements. Now, as we move to a smaller more compact Internet experience, we see the shift into designing for everything.
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
	* Visually impaired people rely heavily on readers that access site elements by tags and titles. They most certainly can use a website to gather information, like the web was intended. I think development should be done to access the largest possible audience, that means to design sites for visually impaired, audio impairement, and the likes. Websites should be accessible to everyone by everyone.
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
	* The idea of responsive design is both cool and functional to me. I see the great need for somethign like this on the web and will do my best to design with media quries in mind. I'm not sure anythign I learned seemed stupid and the concepts in this challenge were pretty solidfied for me.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
	* Nothing to list here.
