# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
	* I tend to use Web standards quite often. I think they are increasingly important with the availability of web tools and development to more and more people. The section, article, etc. is a bit much to grasp at first but its importance in a unified web cannot be missed. Resetting a CSS with the many browsers available is a great option to ensure your site looks well amongst all devices as well. 
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
	* The difference between aside and nav doesn'y really help me and some of the organizational concepts are a bit lost on me, but I found a website that I listed below that helped explain it a bit more for me. The sizes make sense for web but some of the min/max doesn't translate to mobile standards, in my opinion. I did see some sites explain items such as device widths max for alternate viewports. 
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
	* As I said before, some of that doesn't entirely make sense for nesting and displaying, but having these sections is EXTREMELY useful for debugging and setting up web pages. I love the sections being broken up by tags to identify them.
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
	* Reset.css is necessary to clear out browser styles so your website doesn't take on default styles and your styles applied in the stylesheet will take affect. 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
	* I have used Chrome, Safari and Firefox, with Chrome being my primary browser. I have seen slight changes in each browser and I feel like this is a horrible thing for designers and web-viewers. There should be a decent standard put in place for web-browsers to display these HTML styles the same, always. 
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
	* This site helped me with sections, articles and the likes. http://css-tricks.com/snippets/html/html5-page-structure/
