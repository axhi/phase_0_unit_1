// My role in the group is: Translate tests into user stories

// Here is my part of the challenge:

// Test for sums

// I want to take numbers from a set of numbers and add them all together. The list of numbers can have any amount
// of numbers in it. The test will take the first number from the list and add it to the total within itself. The test
// will continue to add the next number in the list to the previous total until there are no more numbers in the list.
// The value, after all numbers in the list are added, will be our sum.

// test for median
// I want to order a list of numbers from smallest to largest. After the list has been ordered, I want to find the
// middle of the list by taking the total numbers in the list and dividing by two. The test should be able to return
// return the middle for all odd numbered lists by finding out if dividing by two doesn't produce a whole number.
// If a whole number isn't found, or there is a reaminder when dividing, it should just look for the middle number in
// our list. 

// test for mean
// I want to take the sum of all numbers in the list, by using the test for adding all numbers together until there
// are no numbers left. Once I have found that number, I want to divide the sum by the amount of numbers in the list.
